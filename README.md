Key Features

1. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Key Exchange

Uses experimental post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, including:

Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., NTRU, FrodoKEM).

Code-based cryptography (e.g., McEliece).


Enables multi-user key sharing for secure communication.


2. Quantum-Chaos Hybrid Encryption

Combines chaotic cryptographic methods with quantum-resistant encryption for added security.

Uses hardware-based randomness (TPM, RDRAND) for entropy generation.


3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for Authentication

Implements ZK-SNARKs (with universal trusted setup), ZK-STARKs, and lattice-based ZKPs.

Provides privacy-preserving authentication without revealing private keys.


4. Decentralized Authentication with ZK-Rollups

Integrates ZK-Rollups for scalable, blockchain-based authentication.

Reduces computational costs while maintaining security and privacy.


5. Post-Quantum Secure Digital Signatures

Uses stateless, hash-based digital signatures (SPHINCS+).

Ensures message integrity and long-term security against quantum attacks.


6. Multi-Signature and Threshold Signature Support

Supports multi-signature authentication, allowing multiple parties to verify transactions.

Implements threshold signatures, enabling only a subset of authorized users to sign messages.

Optimizes threshold configuration for security and efficiency.


7. Off-Chain Computation with ZK-Proofs

Reduces blockchain congestion by processing computations off-chain while ensuring security with ZK-Proofs.

Improves efficiency in verifying transactions and authentication.


8. Hardware-Based Randomness for Enhanced Security

Uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Intel RDRAND, or custom entropy sources for cryptographic randomness.

Enhances the unpredictability of encryption keys and authentication tokens.
