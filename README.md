Quantum-Chaos-Hybrid-Encryption-QCHE-

This encryption method merges chaotic systems and quantum-inspired key distribution to create an unpredictable and highly secure encryption mechanism.

1. Key Generation (Quantum-Inspired)

Instead of traditional key exchange, this system simulates quantum properties using pseudo-random numbers generated from chaotic maps (e.g., the Lorenz or Logistic map).

The encryption key is generated using a quasi-random entropy source, such as real-world quantum noise measurements or chaotic attractors.


2. Encryption Process

A dynamic chaotic function modifies the encryption key at each encryption step.

The plaintext is XORed with a self-evolving key, making frequency analysis impossible.

A multi-layer transformation uses nonlinear diffusion and permutation to obfuscate the ciphertext.


3. Adaptive Key Mutation

The encryption key changes after each block encryption cycle using a chaotic feedback loop, ensuring that even identical plaintexts encrypt differently every time.

The key evolution is influenced by past ciphertext blocks, making replay attacks impossible.


4. Post-Quantum Resilience

Because the key is generated dynamically and never stored, quantum computers cannot retrieve it via Shor’s or Grover’s algorithms.

Even if a quantum computer were to break one encryption cycle, the next cycle uses an entirely new key structure.


5. Self-Destruct Mechanism

The system can implement zero-knowledge self-erasure, meaning that after a set time or unsuccessful access attempts, the encryption key dissolves irreversibly.
